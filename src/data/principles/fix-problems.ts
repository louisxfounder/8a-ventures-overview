We only start businesses that solve real problems. If there's no genuine need, there's no reason to begin.

1. Identify Real Problems
• Look for genuine difficulties people face
• Focus on problems that affect many people or cause significant issues
• Verify that the problem is worth solving

2. Create Real Solutions
• Build solutions that directly address the core problem
• Make sure the solution is better than existing alternatives
• Test solutions with real users to confirm they work

3. Measure Impact
• Track how well our solution fixes the problem
• Get feedback from users about what works and what doesn't
• Keep improving based on real results

4. Stay Focused on Value
• Don't get distracted by fancy features that don't solve the core problem
• Keep asking "Does this actually help solve the problem?"
• Remove anything that doesn't contribute to the solution

In Short
"We Fix Problems That Matter" means we:
1. Find real problems worth solving
2. Create solutions that work
3. Measure our impact
4. Stay focused on delivering real value

We're not here to build things just because we can. We're here to solve problems that make a difference in people's lives.`
