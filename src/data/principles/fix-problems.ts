  content: `We Fix Problems That Matter

We only start businesses that solve real problems. If there's no genuine need, there's no reason to begin.

Key Areas of Focus:

• Look for genuine difficulties people face
• Focus on problems that affect many people or cause significant issues
• Verify that the problem is worth solving
• Build solutions that directly address the core problem
• Make sure the solution is better than existing alternatives
• Test solutions with real users to confirm they work

Measuring Success:

• Track how well our solution fixes the problem
• Get feedback from users about what works and what doesn't
• Keep improving based on real results

Staying Focused:

• Don't get distracted by fancy features that don't solve the core problem
• Keep asking "Does this actually help solve the problem?"
• Remove anything that doesn't contribute to the solution

In Short:
• Find real problems worth solving
• Create solutions that work
• Measure our impact
• Stay focused on delivering real value

We're not here to build things just because we can. We're here to solve problems that make a difference in people's lives.`
