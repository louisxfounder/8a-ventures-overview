We explain everything in a way anyone can understand. No fancy words, no hidden details—everyone should know what's going on and why.

Communication Guidelines:

• When we talk in simple terms, there's less chance of misunderstanding
• Everyone knows what's expected, who's responsible, and how tasks need to be done
• Plain language means we're not hiding behind fancy words or vague statements
• We treat each other with courtesy but also speak honestly
• Clear language cuts out wasted time and energy
• We avoid long, drawn-out chats about what someone "really meant"

Team Alignment:

• We're all on the same boat - if one person is confused, it slows everyone down
• By using language anyone can follow, we help each other stay aligned on goals
• Everyone should know what problem they solve or what value they add
• This avoids long back-and-forths about who does what

Communication Best Practices:

• If someone isn't meeting expectations, we tell them directly but respectfully
• We focus on the issue, not the person
• Use words everyone understands, especially for key processes or tools
• No insider jargon that leaves newer team members or partners confused
• Keep status reports and meeting points as short as possible
• If more detail is needed, we schedule a separate, focused discussion

In Short:
• Everyone knows the plan
• Everyone speaks up when there's a problem
• We avoid fancy talk that wastes time
• We stay direct but respectful
• We deliver on promises without confusion`
