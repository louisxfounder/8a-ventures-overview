We explain everything in a way anyone can understand. No fancy words, no hidden details—everyone should know what's going on and why.

Why We Use Plain Language
1. Straightforward Communication
• When we talk in simple terms, there's less chance of misunderstanding.
• Everyone knows what's expected, who's responsible, and how tasks need to be done.

2. Respect & Team Unity
• Plain language means we're not hiding behind fancy words or vague statements.
• We treat each other with courtesy but also speak honestly, so issues are addressed quickly and without disrespect.

3. Efficiency & Focus
• Clear language cuts out wasted time and energy.
• We want to avoid long, drawn-out chats about what someone "really meant." Instead, we get straight to the point.

4. Shared Purpose
• We're all on the same boat. If one person is confused, it slows everyone down.
• By using language anyone can follow, we help each other stay aligned on goals.

The Bare Minimum Building Blocks for Clear Communication

1. Direct, Polite Feedback
• If someone isn't meeting expectations, we tell them directly but respectfully.
• We focus on the issue, not the person—"Here's what's going wrong, here's how we can fix it."

2. Agreed Roles & Responsibilities
• Everyone should know what problem they solve or what value they add.
• This avoids long back-and-forths about who does what.

3. Simple, Consistent Vocabulary
• Use words everyone understands, especially for key processes or tools.
• No insider jargon that leaves newer team members or partners confused.

4. Brief, Clear Updates
• Keep status reports and meeting points as short as possible, covering just the essentials.
• If more detail is needed, we can schedule a separate, focused discussion.

In Short
"We Use Plain Language" means everyone knows the plan, everyone speaks up when there's a problem, and we avoid fancy talk that wastes time. When we're direct but respectful, we stay efficient and united—delivering on our promises without confusion or unnecessary chatter.`
