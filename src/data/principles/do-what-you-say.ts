  content: `We Build Trust by Doing What We Say

We stay honest, stick to our promises, and show real examples of our work. Trust grows when actions match words.

1. Clear Commitments
• Define the Goal: Be specific about what we plan to deliver—whether it's a product, service, or result.
• Set Realistic Timelines: Provide honest estimates for when each milestone will be reached.
• Outline Potential Risks: Share any known hurdles or uncertainties so everyone is aware of possible delays or changes.

2. Follow Through on Promises
• Honor Agreements: If we say we'll finish by a certain date, we put in the effort to make that happen.
• Stay Transparent: If we run into an obstacle, we communicate it quickly and adjust the plan in a clear way—no last-minute surprises.

3. Handle Problems & Changes Responsibly
• Adapt, Don't Abandon: If circumstances force us to pivot, we still aim to deliver something valuable or find another route to meet our commitments.
• Stay Aligned: Even if the plan changes, everyone involved understands the new direction and updated timeline.

4. Consistent Communication
• Regular Check-Ins: Give updates on progress, risks, or changes—keeping teammates, partners, and clients in the loop.
• Own Mistakes: If something goes wrong, we take responsibility and quickly address it, showing we value honesty over blaming or hiding.

In Short
"We Build Trust by Doing What We Say" means we:
1. Set clear, realistic goals.
2. Stand by our word—and if we need to pivot, we do so transparently and responsibly.
3. Communicate risks and progress so no one feels left in the dark.

By consistently delivering on promises and handling problems openly, we earn the trust of customers, partners, and team members alike.`
