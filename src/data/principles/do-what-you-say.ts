  content: `We Build Trust by Doing What We Say

We stay honest, stick to our promises, and show real examples of our work. Trust grows when actions match words.

1. Clear Commitments
    • Define the Goal: Be specific about what we plan to deliver
    • Set Realistic Timelines: Provide honest estimates for when each milestone will be reached
    • Outline Potential Risks: Share any known hurdles or uncertainties upfront

2. Follow Through on Promises
    • Honor Agreements: If we say we'll finish by a certain date, we put in the effort to make that happen
    • Stay Transparent: If we run into an obstacle, we communicate it quickly and adjust the plan clearly

3. Handle Problems & Changes Responsibly
    • Adapt, Don't Abandon: If circumstances force us to pivot, we still aim to deliver something valuable
    • Stay Aligned: Even if the plan changes, everyone involved understands the new direction

4. Consistent Communication
    • Regular Check-Ins: Give updates on progress, risks, or changes
    • Own Mistakes: If something goes wrong, we take responsibility and quickly address it

In Short:
"We Build Trust by Doing What We Say" means we:
    1. Set clear, realistic goals
    2. Stand by our word—and if we need to pivot, we do so transparently
    3. Communicate risks and progress clearly
    4. Handle problems openly and honestly

By consistently delivering on promises and handling problems openly, we earn the trust of customers, partners, and team members alike.`
