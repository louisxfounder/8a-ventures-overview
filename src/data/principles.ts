Understanding External vs. Internal Problems

When people seek out a product or service, they usually start with an external problem—something obvious and surface-level, like:
• "My photos aren't safely stored."
• "I'm not losing weight despite my efforts."
• "I can't find a good daycare."

But the real trigger that makes them actually buy comes from their internal problem—the feeling behind that external need. It might be anxiety ("What if someone sees my private photos?"), shame ("I feel embarrassed about my weight"), or worry ("Am I failing my child by not finding good daycare?").

Why This Matters:
• People's buying decisions often hinge on their emotions, not just the facts.
• Speaking to the internal problem (the fear, anxiety, frustration, or longing) makes your solution resonate more deeply.
• When you acknowledge both the external issue and the internal struggle, customers are more likely to trust you, because you're addressing what they truly feel.

Goal:
• Present a product that fixes the external issue (e.g., an app for secure photo storage).
• Communicate how it eases the internal worry or frustration ("Feel at peace knowing your personal pictures stay private").

1. Why People Buy: The Basics

People Have Problems or Desires
• They might feel a specific pain (e.g., data loss stress, being overweight) or want to reach a goal (e.g., stronger body, safer photos).
• Example: A busy parent is frustrated that all their personal photos are scattered and unprotected online, and they're worried about leaks.

They Pay for Solutions
• If a product/service clearly solves a real, pressing issue, people see it as valuable.
• Example: This busy parent is willing to pay for a secure photo storage app if it truly keeps their pictures private.

Motivation: Pain Relief or Goal Fulfillment
• Pain Relief: "I'm tired of worrying about X; I need relief now."
• Goal Fulfillment: "I want to reach Y, and I need help getting there."
• Example: Pain relief = fear of embarrassing photo leaks; goal fulfillment = the confidence of knowing precious memories are safe.

Value = Problem Solved
• The bigger or more urgent the problem, the higher the perceived value in fixing it.
• Example: If losing or leaking photos would cause major anxiety, then a reliable privacy solution is seen as extremely valuable.

2. The Hero's Journey (StoryBrand Approach)

In StoryBrand, we position the customer as the hero of the story. You (as the business) act as the guide who helps them on their journey. The framework often looks like this:

A Hero Has a Problem
• The customer (hero) is facing a challenge or gap.
• Example Hero Problem: "I'm worried someone will see my private photos" or "I can't lose weight despite trying so many diets."

They Meet a Guide
• The business (guide) appears with empathy (understanding the problem) and authority (offering a proven solution).
• Example: "Our secure app ensures your photos remain private, using top-level encryption."

The Guide Gives Them a Plan
• Present a simple path for the hero to follow.
• Example Steps:
1. Download the secure photo app.
2. Sync your photo library.
3. Rest easy knowing your pictures are safe.

Call to Action
• The hero is prompted to use or buy the solution.
• Example CTA: "Start your free trial and protect your memories today!"

Success or Failure
• Success: The hero solves their problem and feels relief, pride, or excitement.
• Failure: Without the solution, the hero remains stuck, anxious, or at risk.
• Example: Success = no more stress or fear of leaks; Failure = embarrassing data breach, or losing important pictures forever.

3. Tying It All Together: Examples

A. Weight-Loss Journey
• Hero's Problem (External): "I'm overweight and it hurts my self-confidence."
• Hero's Problem (Internal): "I feel ashamed and out of control."
• Guide's Plan: Provide a simple diet/exercise roadmap + a supportive community.
• Call to Action: "Join our 30-day program and see real progress."
• Success: "Lose weight, feel confident, and gain energy," or Failure: stay stuck in low self-esteem.

B. Secure Photo Storage
• Hero's Problem (External): "My personal images aren't safe—someone could hack or leak them."
• Hero's Problem (Internal): "I'm anxious about being humiliated or invaded."
• Guide's Plan: "Download our private app, sync your photos, and safeguard them with encryption."
• Call to Action: "Get the premium version for total peace of mind."
• Success: "My memories are protected, and I feel relieved;" or Failure: "I stay worried about leaks."

4. Why This Matters for Your Business

• Emotional Connection: Recognizing the internal struggle (fear, anxiety, frustration) fosters deeper trust.
• Clear, Simple Plan: When customers see an easy path forward, they're more likely to act.
• Sense of Urgency: By highlighting what they might lose or miss out on, you help them realize the cost of not solving the problem.
• Lasting Customer Loyalty: Guiding someone from problem to solution builds a strong relationship, often leading to repeat business or referrals.

5. Practical Tips

1. Speak to the Internal Problem: Whether it's fear, shame, or frustration, show you understand how they feel.
2. Offer a Straightforward Plan: Present just a few steps so they're not overwhelmed.
3. Use Before/After Visions: Paint a clear picture of the hero's life if they do (or don't) take action.
4. Stay Honest: Promise only what your solution truly delivers—avoid hype that sets unrealistic expectations.

Final Thoughts

When you combine the idea that people buy to solve both practical and emotional needs with a StoryBrand-style narrative, you create a powerful message that resonates. Customers see themselves as the hero, facing a real challenge, guided by a trustworthy mentor (your business) who provides a clear plan and outcome. This aligns why people buy with the hero's journey—turning everyday transactions into meaningful solutions.`

    id: "start-small",
    title: "Start Small",
    content: `We Start Small
We keep teams and plans simple at first. This helps us move quickly, learn fast, and avoid taking on too much too soon.

1. The Theory: Why Start Small?
	1.	Fast Learning & Flexibility
	•	Small teams can adapt to new information quickly. When fewer people are involved, decisions happen faster and there’s less internal “red tape.”
	•	This lets you test ideas, gather feedback, and make pivots without wasting time or resources on something that might not work.
	2.	Lower Upfront Costs
	•	Keeping the initial team small reduces payroll and overhead.
	•	You’re spending fewer resources in the early stages, which minimizes risk if the project doesn’t pan out.
	3.	Clear Communication
	•	In a small team, everyone knows their role, and everyone knows what’s happening. There’s less confusion about who does what.
	•	This clarity helps ensure consistent quality and prevents tasks from falling through the cracks.
	4.	Focus on What Matters Most
	•	When you can’t afford to hire a large group, you prioritize what truly needs to get done.
	•	This means you focus on core features or services that solve the main problem, rather than adding “nice-to-have” extras.
2. Essential Mechanisms for a Viable Venture
Even when starting small, every business needs basic structures (or “mechanisms”) to function properly:
	1.	Clear Roles & Responsibilities
	•	Even if there are only 2–3 people, each person must know what they’re responsible for (e.g., product development, marketing, finances).
	•	This prevents overlap and avoids gaps in critical tasks.
	2.	A Basic Operating System (Processes & SOPs)
	•	Even a small venture needs a simple checklist or set of steps for daily tasks (e.g., how to respond to customer inquiries, how to update the website).
	•	Keeping it minimal ensures everyone can follow along without an overload of documentation.
	3.	Financial Tracking
	•	Someone must keep an eye on money in and money out, so you know if the project is financially viable.
	•	This could be done via a simple spreadsheet or accounting software—clarity on cash flow is crucial.
	4.	Product or Service Delivery
	•	A straightforward way to deliver what you’re offering—whether it’s an app, a physical product, or a consulting service.
	•	Focus on the core function (i.e., the main problem you’re solving) rather than every possible feature.
	5.	Feedback Loop
	•	A quick, easy method to gather customer or user feedback—could be email surveys, a Slack channel, or direct calls.
	•	This feedback helps you improve the product and decide what to do next.

3. Creating a Most Viable Product (MVP) with a Most Viable Team
	1.	Most Viable Team
	•	Smallest possible group (often just the founder(s) plus 1–2 key specialists).
	•	Each person covers one or more of the essential mechanisms (e.g., someone handles finances + user feedback, someone else handles product development + marketing basics).
	2.	Most Viable Product
	•	Build or offer only the bare minimum that solves the main problem.
	•	Avoid extras that don’t directly solve that problem—extras can come later once you’ve proven people actually want what you’re making.
	3.	Initial Testing
	•	Roll out the MVP to a small audience (could be friends, family, early adopters, or local testers).
	•	Gather feedback on what works, what doesn’t, and what people truly value.
	4.	Iterate & Refine
	•	Use the feedback to tweak the product or service and to adjust any team roles or processes.
	•	Only add features or expand the team if it becomes necessary for growth or quality improvement.

4. Examples
A. Two-Person Software Startup
	•	Team: One founder with coding skills, another with marketing/finance skills.
	•	MVP: A bare-bones version of the software that solves the user’s main pain point.
	•	Process:
	•	Developer handles building and updating the software.
	•	Marketer sets up a simple landing page, runs small ads, and collects feedback via a Google Form.
	•	Result: Low overhead, fast decision-making, and direct feedback from users to guide improvements.
B. Single-Person E-Commerce
	•	Team: Just the owner, who runs everything with a few freelancers (e.g., a designer or a shipping assistant).
	•	MVP: One or two core products listed on a simple website.
	•	Process:
	•	Owner handles social media posts and order fulfillment.
	•	Feedback from early buyers shapes future product choices.
	•	Result: Minimal startup costs and a direct link between buyer feedback and product updates.

5. Why Starting Small Works
	•	Less Complexity: Fewer people and fewer features mean easier communication and faster action.
	•	Lower Costs: You don’t invest a ton of money before you know if the idea will really work.
	•	Clear Focus: With a smaller scope, you’re forced to prioritize the most important tasks or features.
	•	Easier Pivot: If something isn’t working, it’s simpler to change course when you’re not juggling a large team or a bloated product.

Conclusion
“We Start Small” means launching with a minimal team and building the simplest product that solves a real issue. By doing so, you reduce risk, learn quickly, and use focused resources to make sure your venture is on solid ground before you grow.`

    title: "Plain Language",
    content: `We Use Plain Language

We explain everything in a way anyone can understand. No fancy words, no hidden details—everyone should know what's going on and why.

Why We Use Plain Language
1. Straightforward Communication
• When we talk in simple terms, there's less chance of misunderstanding.
• Everyone knows what's expected, who's responsible, and how tasks need to be done.

2. Respect & Team Unity
• Plain language means we're not hiding behind fancy words or vague statements.
• We treat each other with courtesy but also speak honestly, so issues are addressed quickly and without disrespect.

3. Efficiency & Focus
• Clear language cuts out wasted time and energy.
• We want to avoid long, drawn-out chats about what someone "really meant." Instead, we get straight to the point.

4. Shared Purpose
• We're all on the same boat. If one person is confused, it slows everyone down.
• By using language anyone can follow, we help each other stay aligned on goals.

The Bare Minimum Building Blocks for Clear Communication

1. Direct, Polite Feedback
• If someone isn't meeting expectations, we tell them directly but respectfully.
• We focus on the issue, not the person—"Here's what's going wrong, here's how we can fix it."

2. Agreed Roles & Responsibilities
• Everyone should know what problem they solve or what value they add.
• This avoids long back-and-forths about who does what.

3. Simple, Consistent Vocabulary
• Use words everyone understands, especially for key processes or tools.
• No insider jargon that leaves newer team members or partners confused.

4. Brief, Clear Updates
• Keep status reports and meeting points as short as possible, covering just the essentials.
• If more detail is needed, we can schedule a separate, focused discussion.

In Short
"We Use Plain Language" means everyone knows the plan, everyone speaks up when there's a problem, and we avoid fancy talk that wastes time. When we're direct but respectful, we stay efficient and united—delivering on our promises without confusion or unnecessary chatter.`
